# RavencoinIPFS Helper

RavencoinIPFS Helper is a drag and drop IPFS helper tool specifically designed for Ravencoin. It allows you to easily upload files to IPFS and obtain the corresponding IPFS hash.

## Prerequisites

2. **IPFS:** Download and install IPFS on your machine. We recommend using ipfs-update for managing IPFS updates. You can find pre-built binaries for IPFS on the [IPFS Distribution page](https://dist.ipfs.tech/#ipfs-update) and the source code on the [IPFS GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-update).
